* dbug -- a vcs-based bug tracker

Decentralized is *not* the right word for this.

dbug is a centralized bug / issues database that uses a vcs (git or
otherwise) to store it's database. Using vcs conflict resolution, dbug
ensures there are no comment or issue conflicts.

There is one daemon that runs, and then any number of user
interfaces. Ideally there will be an emacs interface, as that's
something I truly enjoy using.

* Format

The format of dbug is merely Maildir. This should make it easy to
implement editors / UI.

Each bug has the following layout

* Configuration

dbug can be configured by adding a dbug.conf file to your
repository. You configure the following entities:

- vcs :: which vcs to use for your project, only one can be supported
     at a time. Default is git.

- remote :: the vcs endpoint to sync with. Currently only one is
     supported. Each VCS will have it's own default. Defaults to origin for git.

- branch :: which branch to use for synchronization. Defaults to master for git.

- interval :: how often to synchronize. Defaults to 0

- editor :: which editor to use for conflict resolution. Defaults to $EDITOR

* Usage

- dbug pull :: pull issues from remote

- dbug push :: push issues to remote

- dbug list :: list all current issues

- dbug browse :: launch browser UI

- dbug edit :: edit issue
